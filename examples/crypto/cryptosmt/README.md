# CryptoSMT
(More examples: https://github.com/kste/cryptosmt/)


CryptoSMT is an easy to use tool for cryptanalysis of symmetric primitives likes
block ciphers or hash functions. It is based on SMT/SAT solvers like STP, Boolector,
CryptoMiniSat and provides a simple framework to use them for cryptanalytic techniques.

Some of the features are:
* Proof properties regarding the differential behavious of a primitive.
* Find the best linear/differential trails.
* Compute probability of a differential.
* Find preimages for hash functions.
* Recover a secret key.

The following primitives are supported by CryptoSMT at the moment:

###### Block Ciphers
* Simon[3],
* Speck[3],
* Skinny[4],
* Present[5],
* Midori[6],
* LBlock[7],
* Sparx[8],
* Twine[9],
* Noekeon[10],
* Prince[11],
* Mantis[4],
* Speckey[8],
* Rectangle[12],
* Cham[13],
* CRAFT[21],
* TRIFLE[22]

###### Hash Functions
* Keccak[14]

###### Stream Ciphers
* Salsa[15],
* ChaCha[16]

###### Authenticated Encryption Ciphers
* Ketje[17],
* Ascon[18]

###### Message Authentication Codes
* Chaskey[19],
* SipHash[20]

Please note that at the moment not all features are available for all ciphers. A
detailed description on the application of this tool on the SIMON block ciphers and
how a differential/linear model for SIMON can be constructed is given in [1].

## Installation

CryptoSMT requires you to have [STP](https://github.com/stp/stp) and
[Cryptominisat](https://github.com/msoos/cryptominisat/) installed and setup the
paths to the binaries in `config.py`. Further it requires the `pyyaml` which you
can install using

    $ pip3 install pyyaml

The easiest way to get all the external tools to run is with the provided
Dockerfile. You can build a basic image using:

    cd docker/
    docker build -t cryptosmt .

This includes building minisat, cryptominisat, STP, boolector and all
dependencies. You can then run the image with:

    docker run -it cryptosmt

which gives you a ready to use setup of CryptoSMT.

## Usage

As an example we will look at how CryptoSMT can be used to find the optimal
differential characteristics for the block cipher Simon.

Running the command

    $ python3 cryptosmt.py --cipher simon --rounds 8 --wordsize 16

will start the search for the optimal trail and you will see as output

    simon - Rounds: 8 Wordsize: 16
    ---
    Weight: 0 Time: 0.0s
    Weight: 1 Time: 0.08s
    Weight: 2 Time: 0.16s
    Weight: 3 Time: 0.44s
    Weight: 4 Time: 0.74s
    Weight: 5 Time: 0.89s
    ...

CryptoSMT tries to find a differential trail with a given weight `w_i`.
If no such trail exists `w_i` is incremented and the search continues.
In this case the best trail has a weight of `18` and can be quickly
found:

    Characteristic for simon - Rounds 8 - Wordsize 16 - Weight 18 - Time 13.15s
    Rounds  x       y       w
    -------------------------------
    0       0x0040  0x0191  -2
    1       0x0011  0x0040  -4
    2       0x0004  0x0011  -2
    3       0x0001  0x0004  -2
    4       0x0000  0x0001  -0
    5       0x0001  0x0000  -2
    6       0x0004  0x0001  -2
    7       0x0011  0x0004  -4
    8       0x0040  0x0011  none

    Weight: 18

CryptoSMT prints out the difference in the two state words `x_i`, `y_i`
and the probability for the transition between two rounds `w_i`.

## Adding a cipher to the CryptoSMT's cipher suites

Let's say you want to add "NewCipher" to the tool:
1. Make a copy from an example in "./ciphers/" which is similar to the design you want to analyze (for example if you want an
ARX, Speck might be a good start) and rename it to "NewCipher.py".
2. Modify the content of "NewCipher.py" to adapt it to your cipher (here it's best to look at some examples, as it depends a lot on design).
3. Update the file "cryptosmt.py": Add "NewCipher" in the import (line 8), and include it in the tool by adding it to the ciphersuite (line 25).
4. Run "python3 cryptosmt.py --cipher NewCipher" to see if it works.

## How does it work?

We can describe the process of the CryptoSMT as the following steps:
1. It creates an stp file which contains the SMT model of the differential cryptanaysis of the given cipher in CVC format (this file is placed in "./tmp/" folder)
2. After generation of SMT model in CVC format, it calls an SMT solver to solve the generated model. The STP is used by default as SMT solver. You can also use the Boolector as SMT solver.
3. The SMT model contains some inherent constraints which are used for modeling the differential propagation rules, and some additional constraints which are used to model the outside counditions like the fixed input/output differentials values.
4. One of the additional constraints is the starting weight (of the differential probability) constraint. The first SMT model is generated with the starting weight, and this model is changed repeatedly by increasing the weight by one, and each time, it's satisfiablity is checked by an SMT solver. The goal is to find the minimum weight which makes the model satisfiable.
5. If the SMT model is satisfiable for the first time, the weight (of the differential probability) which is used, is reteurned as the minimum weight (of the differential probability) as one of the output, and the process is stoped.

These processes are almost realted to the mod0, which is used to find the best differential with maximum (minimum) differential probablity (weight).
