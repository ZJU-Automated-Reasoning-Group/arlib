Playing wth Quantifiers

Quantifiers
================

Quantifiers are fundamental logical operators that express properties over sets of values:

- Universal Quantifier (∀): expresses that a property holds for all values
- Existential Quantifier (∃): expresses that a property holds for at least one value

=======================
Solving General Quantified Problems
=======================


The basic idea of quantifier instantiation is to replace a quantified formula with
a finite set of instances that are obtained by substituting concrete terms for the quantified variables.

Instantiation Techniques

1. **E-matching**:
2. **Model-based**: MBQI (model-based quantifier instantiation)
3. **Enumerative**:

=======================
Quantifier Elimination
=======================

Quantifier elimination refers to the process of eliminating the quantifiers from a formula by
constructing an equivalent quantifier-free formula.

We can apply Skolemization to remove the :math:`\exists` quantifiers. After that, it is sufficient to
instantiate the :math:`\forall` quantifiers for each constant.
For example, :math:`\forall x: T\ A` becomes :math:`A[c_1/x] \land A[c_2/x] \land \ldots`.
The result is equi-satisfiable and quantifier-free.


It is important to understand the differences between Skolemization and quantifier elimination:

- First, Skolemization does not preserve the formula's meaning (it preserves satisfiabilty, but not equivalence)
- Second, QE replaces a formula with an equivalent but quantifier-free formula
- Third, QE is only possible for specific theories, and is generally very expensive
