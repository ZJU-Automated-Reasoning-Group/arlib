SRK Symbolic Reasoning Kit
==========================

The package ``arlib.srk`` is arlib's Symbolic Reasoning Kit: a Python port of the
SRK framework for symbolic manipulation, verification, and automated reasoning.
It bundles expression syntax, algebraic domains, SMT backends, and termination
analyses under a single interface that interoperates with the rest of arlib.

Overview
--------

* Build typed symbolic expressions and formulas with ``Context`` and helpers
* Integrate with SMT solvers through the generic ``SMTSolver`` API and the
  ``Z3Solver`` implementation
* Manipulate polynomials, polyhedra, and abstract domains for program analysis
* Encode transition systems, ranking functions, and fixpoint computations
* Parse, simplify, and export problems via SMT-LIB utilities

Subsystems
----------

**Syntax and Rewriting** ``syntax``, ``srkSimplify``, ``srkAst``
    Core classes for terms, formulas, and types. Provides builders such as
    ``mk_symbol``, ``mk_add``, ``mk_eq`` plus normalisation utilities like
    ``simplify_expression`` and CNF/NNF converters.

**SMT Integration** ``smt``, ``srkZ3``, ``srkSmtlib2``
    Translate SRK expressions to solver terms, manage solver scopes, and parse
    SMT-LIB 2 benchmarks. Includes helpers for models, unsat cores, and Z3
    interoperability.

**Abstract Interpretation and Algebra** ``abstract``, ``interval``, ``polyhedron``,
``linear``, ``polynomial``, ``wedge``
    Implement numerical domains (intervals, affine relations, polyhedra),
    rational arithmetic (``qQ``/``zZ``), exponential polynomials, and operations
    needed for invariant generation and completeness proofs.

**Transition Systems and Termination** ``transition``, ``transitionFormula``,
``transitionSystem``, ``termination``, ``loop``
    Model program control-flow, compose transitions, and search for ranking
    functions with LLRF/DTA/exp-based strategies.

**Utilities and Infrastructure** ``cache``, ``memo``, ``log``, ``sparseMap``,
``srkUtil``
    Support modules for performance profiling, memoisation, data structures, and
    combinatorial helpers used throughout the kit.

Getting Started
---------------

.. code-block:: python

   from arlib.srk import (
       Context, Type,
       mk_symbol, mk_const, mk_add, mk_eq,
       simplify_expression, Z3Solver, SMTResult
   )

   ctx = Context()
   x = mk_symbol(ctx, "x", Type.INT)
   y = mk_symbol(ctx, "y", Type.INT)

   formula = mk_eq(mk_add(mk_const(x), mk_const(y)), mk_const(x))
   simplified = simplify_expression(formula, ctx)

   solver = Z3Solver(ctx)
   solver.add([simplified])

   if solver.check() == SMTResult.SAT:
       model = solver.get_model()
       print("Satisfiable:", model.get_value(x))
   else:
       print("Unsatisfiable or unknown")

Working with SMT-LIB
--------------------

``srkParse`` and ``srkSmtlib2Defs`` translate SMT-LIB 2 problems into SRK
expressions, while ``srkSimplify`` can normalise the resulting formulas before
they are handed to ``Z3Solver`` or exported back to SMT-LIB. The combination
allows rapid experimentation with new reasoning algorithms while reusing SRK's
infrastructure for parsing, simplification, and solver interaction.

``arlib/srk/tests`` for concrete usage patterns covering algebraic manipulation,
quantifier handling, and program analysis workflows.
