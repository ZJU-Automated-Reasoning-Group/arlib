Parallel SMT CDCL(T) Solving
=================================


==========
CDCL(T)
==========


CDCL(T) stands for Conflict-Driven Clause Learning modulo Theory, which is a powerful
algorithm for solving Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) problems.
It extends the CDCL algorithm used in SAT solving to handle theories beyond
pure propositional logic.

- Combines boolean reasoning (SAT) with theory reasoning
- Maintains a boolean abstraction of the formula
- Performs theory-specific consistency checks
- Learns new clauses from conflicts
