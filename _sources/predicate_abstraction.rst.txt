Predicate Abstraction
====================

Introduction to Predicate Abstraction
-----------------------------------

Predicate abstraction is a technique for constructing finite-state abstractions
from large or infinite-state systems.

The fundamental operation in predicate abstraction can be summarized as follows:
Given a formula φ and a set of predicates P in a theory T, generate the most
precise approximation of φ using P.

Depending on the nature of the problem domain, one may either want to generate:

(i) the best underapproximation of φ, i.e., the weakest Boolean combination
    of P that implies φ (denoted by FP(φ)) or

(ii) the best overapproximation of φ, i.e., the strongest Boolean combination of P
     that is implied by φ (denoted by GP(φ)).

Here, the notions of weakness, strength and implication are with respect
to entailment in the given theory T.


Consider the following simple C loop:

```c
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    i++;
}
```
Suppose we choose the following predicates as our abstraction:

```c
P1: i < 10
P2: i >= 10
```

An element in the abstract domain is a Boolean combination of the predicates.
For example, P1 ∨ P2 is an element in the abstract domain.

The predicate abstraction algorithm aims to infer an inductive invariant for the loop expressed as a Boolean combination of the predicates (similar to an interval invariant in the interval abstract domain).
