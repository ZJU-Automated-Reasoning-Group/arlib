# Arlib 

Arlib is toolkit for automated reasoning. It provides a set of tools for constraint solving, logical inference, and symbolic computation.


## Local Development Environment

Run the following command to setup the local development environment.
~~~~
bash setup_local_env.sh
~~~~


The script will 
- Create a Python virtual environment if it doesn't exist
- Activate the virtual environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt
- Download required solver binaries (CVC5, MathSAT, z3)
- Run unit tests if available

TBD:
- Test the scripts on different platforms, editors/IDEs, etc.

## Install the Library Locally

Local installziation via setup.py
~~~~
pip install -e .
~~~~

Then you can use a few cli tools of this library, add call the Python API in your own Python code.

## Release the Repo to PyPI

TBD (The repository is not yet released to PyPI.)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please refer to the repository for detailed instructions on how to contribute.
