# MCAI

## DONE
- Compute the abstractions
- Count the models
- Compare the precision

## TODO
Use MCAI to understand static analyses

### Impact of overflow / underflow 
- Prevent overflow / underflow for all relevant operations in a given SMT formula
  (by adding additional assertions)
- Analyze the presence of overflow / underflow for all relevant operations in a given SMT formula

## Impact of precision-enhancement strategies
- Disjunctive abstraction?
- Specialized bit-level domains?
- Reduced product of (multiple) domains?
- ...?
