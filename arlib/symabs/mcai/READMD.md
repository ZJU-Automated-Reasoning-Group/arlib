# Model Counting Meets Abstract Interpretation (MCAI)

## DONE

- Compute the abstractions
- Count the models
- Compare the precision

## TODO

Use MCAI to understand static analyses

### Impact of overflow / underflow

- Prevent overflow / underflow for all relevant operations in a given SMT formula
  (by adding additional assertions)
- Analyze the presence of overflow / underflow for all relevant operations in a given SMT formula

## Impact of precision-enhancement strategies

- Disjunctive abstraction?
- Specialized bit-level domains?
- Reduced product of (multiple) domains?
- ...?
