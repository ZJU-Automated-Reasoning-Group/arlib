Context-Free Language (CFL) Reachability Solver

This module implements a solver for CFL-reachability problems using Dynamic
Transitive Closure (DTC) algorithms with quantum computing optimizations.
The solver can analyze whether certain paths exist in a graph that satisfy
a given context-free grammar.

The implementation includes:
- DTC-based CFL-reachability algorithm
- Quantum iteration estimation using Grover's search
- Worklist-based analysis for efficient computation
- Support for various grammar production rules
