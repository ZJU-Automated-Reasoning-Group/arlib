CFL-Reachability Analysis with Quantum Optimization Estimation

This script performs CFL-reachability analysis on input graphs using context-free
grammars and estimates the potential quantum computing speedup using Grover's
search algorithm. It compares classical and quantum iteration counts for
performance analysis.

The script reads a graph file (DOT format) and a grammar file (EBNF format),
then runs the CFL-reachability algorithm while tracking both classical and
quantum iteration counts.

Usage:
    python3 CFGR.py <graph_file> [grammar_file] [data_structure] [mode]

    graph_file: Path to the input graph file (DOT format)
    grammar_file: Path to the grammar file (default: demo/VM_Grammar.txt)
    data_structure: Graph data structure to use (default: Matrix)
    mode: Solving mode (default: Cubic)

Example:
    python3 CFGR.py demo/100KB.dot demo/VM_Grammar.txt Matrix Cubic
