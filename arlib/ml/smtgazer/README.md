# SMTgazer
Welcome to the homepage of SMTgazer!

SMTgazer is an effective algorithm scheduling based method for SMT solving. This repository includes the implementation of SMTgazer and the experimental results.

## Datasets

The BMC, SymEx, and SyGuS datasets can be found on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6521826). The SMT-COMP dataset can be found on StarExec via the [SMT-COMP website](https://smt-comp.github.io/2021/benchmarks.html).

`machfea/*_solver.json` is the file containing the candidate solvers of each dataset.

`machfea/infer_result/` is the folder containing the feature files of each dataset.

`data/` is the folder containing the running time of all solvers for each dataset.

## Getting Started

Before using SMTgazer, make sure you have installed the requirements and SMAC3.

For the requirements, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`smac/` is the folder containing the implementations of SMAC3 with a hybrid model. To install SMAC3, run:

```
python ./smac/setup.py install
```
### Training

If you need to use SMTgazer on your own dataset named "xxx", generate the corresponding json file (`data/xxxLabels.json`) according to the format of `data/*Labels.json` and the file containing the candidate solvers like `machfea/*_solver.json`.

Modify the corresponding dataset name and path in `machfea/mach_run_inference.py`. Generate the feature files by running:

```
cd machfea
python mach_run_inference.py
```

Change line 32 of `batchportfolio.py` to:

```
key_set = ["xxx"]
```

Uncomment the code on line 24 of `batchportfolio.py`, run:

```
python batchportfolio.py
```

The training result will be stored in the folder `output/` with the prefix `train_result`.

### Testing

Uncomment the code on line 26 of `batchportfolio.py`, run:

```
python batchportfolio.py
```

The testing result will be stored in the folder `output/` with the prefix `test_result`.

## Experimental Results

`output/` is the folder containing the scheduling sequences generated by SMTgazer on the datasets.

To calculate the PAR2 score and the number of unsolved instances for each dataset, run:

```
python calc_portfolio_result.py
```
