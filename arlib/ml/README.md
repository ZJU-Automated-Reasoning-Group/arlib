## Usage Examples

### SMTGazer Portfolio Training
```bash
# Extract features for training data
cd machfea
python mach_run_inference.py 0

# Train portfolios for specific SMT categories
cd ../smtgazer
python batchportfolio.py  # Trains on Equality+LinearArith, QF_Bitvec, etc.
```

### Feature Extraction
```bash
# Extract features for a single SMT problem
python get_feature.py problem.smt2 --dataset MyDataset

# Batch feature extraction for multiple problems
python mach_run_inference.py <seed>
```

### Tactic Optimization
```python
from tactic_ga.ga_tactics import TacticSeq, GA

# Create and evaluate a tactic sequence
tactic_seq = TacticSeq.random()
print(tactic_seq.to_string())

# Run genetic algorithm (128 generations)
# ga = GA()
# ga.evaluate(); ga.dump(); ga.repopulate()  # Repeat for 128 generations
```
