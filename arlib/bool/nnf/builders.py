class Builder:
    """Automatically deduplicates NNF nodes as you make them, to save memory.

    Usage:

    >>> builder = Builder()
    >>> var = builder.Var('A')
    >>> var2 = builder.Var('A')
    >>> var is var2
    True

    As long as the Builder object exists, the nodes it made will be kept in
    memory. Make sure not to keep it around longer than you need.

    It's often a better idea to avoid creating nodes multiple times in the
    first place. That will save processing time as well as memory.

    If you use a Builder, avoid using operators. Even negating variables
    should be done with ``builder.Var(name, False)`` or they won't be
    deduplicated.
