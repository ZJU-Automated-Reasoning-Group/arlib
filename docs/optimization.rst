Optimization Modulo Theory
=================

Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT) extends Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT)
by adding optimization capabilities. While SMT focuses on finding satisfying
assignments to formulas in first-order logic with respect to background theories,
OMT additionally allows for finding optimal solutions according to objective
functions.

Currently, we rely on the `pyomt` library for solving OMT problems. (TBD: need
to add it as a requirement)
