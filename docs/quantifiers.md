## Quantifiers

### Solving Quantified Problems
The basic idea of quantifier instantiation is to replace a quantified formula with 
a finite set of instances that are obtained by substituting concrete terms for the quantified variables.


### Quantifier Elimination
 
 Quantifier elimination refers to the process of eliminating the quantifiers from a formula by 
 constructing an equivalent quantifier-free formula.
