Quantifiers
================

Quantifiers are fundamental logical operators that express properties over sets of values:

- Universal Quantifier (∀): expresses that a property holds for all values
- Existential Quantifier (∃): expresses that a property holds for at least one value

Solving General Quantified Problems
-----------------------------------

The basic idea of quantifier instantiation is to replace a quantified formula with
a finite set of instances that are obtained by substituting concrete terms for the quantified variables.

Instantiation Techniques


1. **E-matching**:
2. **Model-based**:
3. **Enumerative**:




Solving Exists-Forall Problems

Quantifier Elimination
------------------------

Quantifier elimination refers to the process of eliminating the quantifiers from a formula by
constructing an equivalent quantifier-free formula.


We can apply Skolemization to remove the :math:`\exists` quantifiers. After that, it is sufficient to
instantiate the :math:`\forall` quantifiers for each constant.
For example, :math:`\forall x: T\ A` becomes :math:`A[c_1/x] \land A[c_2/x] \land \ldots`.
The result is equi-satisfiable and quantifier-free.


It is important to understand the differences between Skolemization and quantifier elimination:

- Skolemization does not preserve the formula's meaning (it preserves satisfiabilty, but not equivalence)
- QE replaces a formula with an equivalent but quantifier-free formula
- QE is only possible for specific theories, and is generally very expensive
