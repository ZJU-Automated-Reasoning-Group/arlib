Model Sampling
=================================


=========
Introduction
=========

Model sampling, also known as solution sampling or witness enumeration, is the process
of generating multiple distinct solutions to a logical formula or constraint system.
This technique is crucial in various applications including:

- Test case generation
- Statistical analysis
- Probabilistic inference
- Verification and validation

Model sampling is a challenging problem due to the following factors:
- The complexity of the underlying logical formulas or constraints.
- The need for generating a large number of diverse solutions.
- Ensuring the uniformity and independence of the samples.
- ...


Key Concepts
-----------

1. **Sampling Methods**:
   - Uniform sampling
   - Weighted sampling
   - Stratified sampling
   - Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

2. **Quality Metrics**:
   - Uniformity
   - Coverage
   - Diversity
   - Independence

3. **Performance Factors**:
   - Sample generation time
   - Memory usage
   - Solution quality
   - Scalability

   .. code-block:: python

      class UniformSampler:
          def __init__(self, formula):
              self.formula = formula

          def sample(self, n):
              # Generate n uniform samples
              pass
