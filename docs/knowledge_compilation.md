# Knowledge Compilation


## Introduction to Knowledge Compilation
Knowledge compilation is a technique in artificial intelligence 
that aims to preprocess a knowledge base or a set of constraints
into a more efficient and compact representation that can be used for 
faster inference or reasoning. The idea is to transform the 
original representation of the knowledge base into a form 
that is easier to manipulate and reason about. This can involve 
various techniques such as decision diagrams. The resulting compiled 
representation can be used to answer queries or solve problems more 
efficiently than the original representation.

### OBDD

OBDD stands for Ordered Binary Decision Diagram. It is a compact data structure used in computer science and artificial intelligence to represent Boolean functions. An OBDD is a directed acyclic graph where each node represents a Boolean variable and has two outgoing edges labeled with 0 and 1, representing the variable being false or true, respectively. The nodes are ordered according to a fixed variable ordering, which ensures that equivalent OBDDs are identical.
