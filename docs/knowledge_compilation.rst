Knowledge Compilation
==============


=======
Introduction to Knowledge Compilation
=======

Knowledge compilation is a technique in artificial intelligence 
that aims to preprocess a knowledge base or a set of constraints
into a more efficient and compact representation that can be used for 
faster reasoning. The idea is to transform the
original representation of the knowledge base into a form 
that is easier to manipulate and reason about, , often involving techniques like decision diagrams.
The compiled representation enables more efficient query answering or problem-solving than the original form.


Key Concepts
-----------

1. **Compilation Target Languages**:
   - Different target languages offer different tradeoffs
   - Each supports different types of queries efficiently
   - Expressiveness vs tractability tradeoff

2. **Compilation Process**:
   - Input knowledge base transformation
   - Structure optimization
   - Query preparation

3. **Query Types**:
   - Model counting
   - Consistency checking
   - Clause entailment
   - Model enumeration

OBDD
------

OBDD stands for Ordered Binary Decision Diagram. It's a compact data structure
used in computer science and artificial intelligence to represent Boolean functions.
An OBDD is a directed acyclic graph where each node represents a Boolean variable
with two outgoing edges labeled 0 and 1, indicating the variable being false or true,
respectively. The nodes are ordered according to a fixed variable ordering, ensuring
that equivalent OBDDs are identical.


DNNF
------

Decomposable Negation Normal Form (DNNF) is a representation of propositional
formulas that allows for tractable query answering while maintaining significant
expressive power.

SDD
-----

Sentential Decision Diagrams (SDD) are a relatively new target language that
combines the benefits of OBDDs and DNNFs.
